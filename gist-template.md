# Regex Is Pretty Cool Honestly

On this page, we will be reviewing the <strong>Regular Expressions</strong> (<strong>RegEx</strong>) and their usages. We will go over examples of <strong>RegEx</strong> and their applications as well as specific parts of the <strong>RegEx syntax</strong>.

## Summary

The specific components of <strong>RegEx</strong> we are going to be going through are groups, ranges, assertions, quantifiers, character classes, flags, and character escapes. Learning all of these aspects of <strong>RegEx</strong> will allow anyone to build extremely useful <strong>RegEx</strong> statements. I will also explain how multiple components can be compounded to form a more useful expression.
